# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Amazon S3 is a service that allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. It is designed to provide 99.999999999% durability and scales past trillions of objects worldwide. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key features and concepts:

## Buckets

Buckets are containers for objects (files) stored in Amazon S3. They must have a globally unique name and are defined at the region level.

### Bucket Naming Conventions:
- No uppercase letters or underscores
- Length between 3-63 characters
- Must not resemble an IP address
- Must start with a lowercase letter or number
- Must not start with the prefix `xn--`
- Must not end with the suffix `-s3alias`

## Objects

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3, consisting of data and metadata.

### Key Components:
- **Key**: A unique identifier for an object within a bucket (composed of a prefix and object name). For example, `s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt`.
- **Metadata**: A set of name-value pairs that describe the object.
- **Tags**: Up to 10 Unicode key-value pairs for organizing and managing access to objects.
- **Version ID**: A unique identifier for each version of an object if versioning is enabled.

## Versioning

Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. It is enabled at the bucket level.

- **Enabled at the bucket level**.
- Allows tracking changes over time.
- Each overwrite creates a new version (e.g., version 1, 2, 3).

## Replication

Amazon S3 supports replication of objects across different regions (Cross-Region Replication - CRR) or within the same region (Same-Region Replication - SRR). Replication requires enabling versioning on both the source and destination buckets.

### Key Points:
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**: Replicates objects to a bucket in another region.
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**: Replicates objects to a bucket in the same region.
- **IAM Permissions**: Proper permissions must be configured.
- **Asynchronous Process**: Replication is not instant.
- **Replication of Deletes**: Optionally replicate delete markers but not deletions with version IDs to avoid malicious deletes.
- **Replication Scope**: Only new objects are replicated unless using S3 Batch Replication for existing objects.

## Storage Classes

Amazon S3 offers various storage classes designed for different use cases:

- **S3 Standard**: General-purpose storage with high durability and availability.
- **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)**: For data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed.
- **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access**: For infrequently accessed data stored in a single availability zone.
- **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**: For long-term archival with instant retrieval.
- **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: Low-cost archive storage with flexible retrieval options.
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: Lowest cost storage for data that is rarely accessed.
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Automatically moves data between two access tiers when access patterns change.

### Lifecycle Policies

Lifecycle policies can be used to automatically transition objects between different storage classes or to delete objects after a certain period.
